    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cook the macaroni in lightly salted water according to the package directions. Drain and rinse under cold water to cool. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper. Splash in enough milk to make it pourable. Splash in pickle juice for extra flavor. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the cooled macaroni in a large bowl and pour in three-fourths of the dressing. Toss and add more dressing if you'd like. (The dressing will seem a little thin, but it will thicken up as the salad chills.)</li>
        <li>Stir in the roasted red peppers (or pimentos), olives, pickles, and green onions. Add more of any ingredient if you'd like more stuff going on! At the end, splash in a little more pickle juice and stir.</li>
        <li>Chill for at least 2 hours before serving. Sprinkle with sliced green onions to serve! </li>

    </ul>
