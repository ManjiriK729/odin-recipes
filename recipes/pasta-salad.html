    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>

        <h3>For the dressing:</h3>
        <li>Place the tomatoes, olives, capers, garlic, and rosemary sprig on a sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with ½ cup of olive oil, and toss to evenly coat.</li>
        <li>Season with black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place in the oven and roast for 25 to 30 minutes (the tomatoes should have released their juices but still hold their shape).</li>
        <li>Discard the rosemary sprig and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Set a large fine mesh strainer over a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Strain the tomatoes, olives, and capers, reserving the liquid for the dressing and the tomatoes, olives, and capers to stir into the salad.</li>
        <li>Remove the garlic from the tomato mixture and add it to the accumulated liquid.</li>
        <li>To a blender, carefully add the liquid mixture, remaining ¼ cup of olive oil, roasted red peppers, almonds, and more black pepper.</li>
        <li>Blend until smooth, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Keep the large bowl to mix the pasta salad; no need to dirty another bowl.</li>

        <h3>For the crispy chickpeas:</h3>
        <li>Spread the chickpeas out on a large kitchen towel and thoroughly rub dry, discarding any loose skins.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chickpeas to a sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Toss the chickpeas to evenly coat and roast until they turn a deep golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the chickpeas from the oven, sprinkle with the crushed red pepper, and carefully toss with a spatula to combine.</li>
        <li>Set aside to cool.</li>

        <h3>For the pasta salad:</h3>
        <li>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes less than the package directions.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the large bowl that held the accumulated tomato juices and olive oil, and set aside (it's okay if a little water collects in the bowl; it will mix with the dressing).</li>
        <li>Add the reserved tomato mixture, giardiniera, smoked mozzarella, basil, and the dressing to the bowl with the pasta, tossing gently to coat.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving bowl and top with extra giardiniera, smoked mozzarella, and basil. Sprinkle on the crispy chickpeas, and serve immediately.</li>
